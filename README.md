# Muscleup

Muscleup is a health and fitness tracking application that allows users to track their workouts and meals using a simple user interface. Users can log their meals and workouts using a natural language query, and the application will parse the query and log the appropriate data. Users can also view their workout and meal history, and view their progress over time using data visualization tools. Muscleup is built using a Python backend and a React frontend. The application is deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. The application is currently in development and is subject to change.

## Usage

Muscleup is a web application that can be accessed at [MuscleUP](https://sonny-ht.gitlab.io/muscleup/). Users can create an account and log in to the application. Once logged in, users can log their meals and workouts by visiting their dashboard.
